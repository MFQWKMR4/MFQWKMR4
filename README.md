# Hi there 👋

- 💻 I have over 5 years of experience as a software engineer, including building web applications and cryptocurrency wallets.
- 🎓 I hold a master’s degree in Computer Science.
- 🌟 I’m skilled in Golang, Scala, and TypeScript. For frontend development, I often work with React.
- 🛠️ On the infrastructure side, I’ve worked with AWS, Kubernetes (k8s), and Terraform.
