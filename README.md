# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently on a career break and studying English in Toronto, Canada.

Iâ€™m skilled in Golang, Scala, and TypeScript. For frontend development, I often work with React.

As a personal project, I enjoy creating original online board games using Cloudflare

If youâ€™re into creating or playing online board games, Iâ€™d love to collaborate or play together!
